# Process workshop

This repository is part of the process workshop at Maker's academy.

You can [see my screen recording solving this here](https://youtu.be/I1GI0Y-nfYw).

The objective of the workshop is to get feedback from your peers (or coaches) on your development process.

The development process includes following 15 minute sprints to do the following:

1. Read & Refine
2. Plan
3. Test
4. Implement
5. Refactor
6. Commit

If the timer runs out (i.e. 15mins are up):

1. Revert
2. Simplify
3. Plan
